# Data-Aware Composition {#sec-data-aware}

This part introduces another core feature of the ggalign package: data-aware
composition. Unlike data-free composition, which focuses solely on the visual
arrangement of plots without considering shared data values, data-aware
composition aligns plots based on common data characteristics—such as shared
axis scales or categorical factors. This enables precise alignment of related
plots where data correspondence matters.

Consider a common scenario in cancer genomics: researchers need to display a heatmap of gene expression alongside mutation data, survival curves, and clinical annotations, all while ensuring that the same patients appear in identical positions across all plots. This seemingly simple requirement becomes complex when using traditional tools, often requiring manual coordinate management and careful data preprocessing.

The `ggalign` package addresses these fundamental challenges by introducing the concept of **observation alignment**—ensuring that identical data points maintain consistent positioning across multiple interconnected plots. This approach transforms how we think about multi-plot visualizations, shifting from spatial arrangement to data-centric composition.


## What Will You Learn?

This part is divided into sections that will guide you through:

- Exploring the `Layout` system and its core types.

- Understanding key concepts of data-aware composition.

- Learning how to align plots based on shared data features.

- Managing discrete and continuous data for alignment.

- Using grouping, ordering, and clustering to organize observations.

- Adding supporting visual elements like dendrograms and annotations.
