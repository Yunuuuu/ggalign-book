# Data-Free Composition {#sec-data-free}

This part introduces one of the core features of the `ggalign` package:
data-free composition. Data-free composition forms the structural foundation for
building complex, multi-panel visual layouts. Unlike data-aware composition, it
does not align plots based on shared data values. Instead, it focuses purely on
the visual arrangement of plots—making it ideal for combining independently
generated figures.

If you're familiar with tools like patchwork or cowplot, you'll find some
similarities. However, `ggalign` extends these ideas with finer control over
alignment, spacing, and `guide`/`legend` collection, allowing you to construct
more precise and expressive layouts.

## What Is Data-Free Composition for?

Use data-free composition when you want to:

* Visually compare results from different models or datasets.

* Combine summary, diagnostic, and metadata plots in figure panels.

* Annotate plots with separate diagrams, legends, or auxiliary views.

* Create layout templates that work across a variety of inputs.

This approach gives you full spatial control while preserving each plot’s
independence. Because there's no need to reconcile axes, or scales, it’s
straightforward and versatile for many common multi-plot needs.

## What Will You Learn?

This part is divided into chapters, each addressing a specific graphical
challenge. This is not an exhaustive or exclusive categorization but rather a
practical guide to help you navigate common tasks in data-free plot composition.
