# Introduction

`ggalign` extends `ggplot2` by providing advanced tools for aligning and
organizing multiple plots, particularly those that automatically reorder
observations, such as dendrogram. It offers fine control over layout adjustment
and plot annotations, enabling you to create complex visualizations while
leveraging the familiar grammar of `ggplot2`.

## Installation

You can install `ggalign` from `CRAN` using:
```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("ggalign")
```

Alternatively, install the development version from
[r-universe](https://yunuuuu.r-universe.dev/ggalign) with:
```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("ggalign",
    repos = c("https://yunuuuu.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

or from [GitHub](https://github.com/Yunuuuu/ggalign) with:
```{r}
#| eval: false
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Yunuuuu/ggalign")
```

## General design
The core feature of `ggalign` lies in its integration of the `grammar of
graphics` into advanced visualization through its object-oriented `Layout`
system. The package provides three main `Layout` classes:

 - the `StackLayout` class: Put plots horizontally or vertically.
 - the `QuadLayout` class: Arranges plots in the four quadrants (top, left,
 bottom, right) around a main plot. This layout is ideal for designs that
 require supplementary plots or annotations surrounding a central figure.
 - the `CircleLayout` class: Positions plots in a circular arrangement.

Each `Layout` class supports the alignment of both discrete (ordinal) and
continuous variables. Depending on the desired alignment across multiple plots
within a layout, the following variants are available:

For `StackLayout`:

 - `stack_discrete()`: Align discrete variable along the stack.
 - `stack_continuous()`: Align continuous variable along the stack.

`stack_layout()` integrates the functionalities of `stack_discrete()` and
`stack_continuous()` into a single interface. For simplicity, throughout this
book, I will refer to both variants as `stack_layout()`.

For `QuadLayout`: 

 - `quad_continuous`/`ggside`: Align continuous variables in both horizontal and vertical directions. 
 - `quad_discrete`: Align discrete variables in both horizontal and vertical directions. 
 - `quad_layout`: Aligns discrete or continuous variables either horizontally or vertically.

The functions `quad_continuous()` and `quad_discrete()` are specialized versions
of `quad_layout()` (@sec-quad-layout-quad-layout): `quad_continuous()` sets both
`xlim` and `ylim` arguments, while `quad_discrete()` does not set `xlim` or
`ylim`. For simplicity, throughout this book, I will refer to all of the
variants as `quad_layout()`.

For `CircleLayout`:

 - `circle_discrete()`: Align discrete variable in the circle.
 - `circle_continuous()`: Align continuous variable in the circle.

`circle_layout()` integrates the functionalities of `circle_discrete()` and
`circle_continuous()` into a single interface. For simplicity, throughout this
book, I will refer to both variants as `circle_layout()`.

## Align axes in ggplot {#sec-align-axes}
Before introducing the package, let's first discuss how to align axes in
ggplot2. For continuous axes, alignment is straightforward because we just need
to ensure that all plots have the same `limits`. This can be achieved in the
`*_continuous()` function by setting the `limits` (or `xlim`/`ylim`) argument.

Aligning discrete axes is more challenging because we must first ensure that the
number of unique discrete values is the same across all plots, and that the
ordering is consistent. In ggplot2, it’s difficult to align discrete axes, since
some plots may self-ordered. This issue is compounded when working with
long-formatted data frames, which is required by ggplot2.

To address this, the `ggalign` package typically uses matrix input for layouts
that require aligning discrete axes (`*_discrete()` functions). Each row of the
matrix represents a unique discrete value (observation), and the number of rows
corresponds to the total number of unique values (number of observations). To
ensure consistent ordering across plots, the internal just need to reorder the
rows. This approach is also well-suited for functions like
`quad_layout()`/`ggheatmap()`, where axes need to be aligned in both directions
simultaneously, as matrices can be transposed (i.e., switching rows to columns
and columns to rows). When drawing the plot, the `ggalign` package will melt the
`matrix` into a long-formatted data frame. You may worry about that the matrix
format may not fully support all input requirements for plots, the `ggalign`
package provides a function (`scheme_data()`) to transform the plot data as
needed to fit your specific use case.

We often refer to "observations" when discussing discrete axes. Observations
typically correspond to discrete variables, such as data points or samples. In
the rest of the book, I will use "observations" and "discrete variables"
interchangeably. You can assume that any reference to "observations" also
applies to discrete variables.

## Getting Started
```{r}
library(ggalign)
```

The usage of `ggalign` is simple if you're familiar with `ggplot2` syntax, the
typical workflow includes: 

  1. Initialize the layout.
  2. Customize the layout with:
      - `align_group()`: Group observations into panel with a group variable.
      - `align_kmeans()`: Group observations into panel by kmeans.
      - `align_order()`: Reorder layout observations based on statistical weights or by manually specifying the observation index.
      - `align_reorder`: Reorder observations using an arbitrary statistical function
      - `align_hclust()`: Reorder or group observations based on hierarchical clustering.
  3. Adding plots with:
      - `align_dendro()`: Add a dendrogram to the plot, and reorder or group observations based on hierarchical clustering.
      - `ggalign()`: Initialize a ggplot object and align the axes.
      - `ggmark()`: Add a plot to annotate selected observations.
      - `ggcross()`: Initialize a ggplot object to connect two different layout crosswise
      - `ggfree()`: Initialize a ggplot object without aligning the axes.
  4. Layer additional `ggplot2` elements such as geoms, stats, or scales.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
small_mat <- matrix(rnorm(56), nrow = 7)
rownames(small_mat) <- paste0("row", seq_len(nrow(small_mat)))
colnames(small_mat) <- paste0("column", seq_len(ncol(small_mat)))
```

Every `*_layout()` function accepts default data, which will be inherited by all
plots within the layout.

Here's a simple example:
```{r}
stack_discretev(small_mat) +               # <1>
    align_dendro() +                       # <2>
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text())    # <3>
```
  1. We initialize a vertical stack.
  2. Reorder the observations based on hierarchical clustering and add a
  dendrogram tree.
  3. Add x-axis text.

This function produces a simple dendrogram. The `stack_discretev()` function
initializes a vertical stack and aligns discrete variables. It is simply an
alias for `stack_discrete("v")`. By default, the axis text on the axis used for
alignment is removed. This is because it's often unclear which plot should
display the axis text, as typically, we want it to appear in only one plot.
However, you can easily use the `theme()` function to control where the axis
text appears.

Internally, `align_dendro()` will reorder the observations based on the
dendrogram, and other plots in the layout will follow this ordering.

```{r}
stack_discretev(small_mat) +                                # <1>
    align_dendro() +                                        # <2>
    ggalign(data = rowSums) +                               # <3>
    geom_bar(aes(.discrete_x, value), stat = "identity") +  # <4>
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text())                     # <5>
```
  1. We initialize a vertical stack.
  2. Reorder the observations based on hierarchical clustering and add a
  dendrogram tree.
  3. Create a new ggplot in the layout, and use data based on the sum of the
  layout data.
  4. Add a bar layer.
  5. Add x-axis text.

The data in the underlying `ggplot` object of `ggalign()` function contains
following columns (more details will be introduced in the [@sec-ggalign]):

 - `.panel`: the group panel for the aligned axis. It means `x-axis` for
 vertical stack layout, `y-axis` for horizontal stack layout.
 - `.x`/`.y` and `.discrete_x`/`.discrete_y`: an integer index of `x`/`y`
   coordinates and a factor of the data labels (only applicable when names
   exists).
 - `.names` and `.index`: A character names (only applicable when names exists)
 and an integer of index of the original data.
 - `value`: the actual value (only applicable if `data` is a `matrix` or
   atomic vector).

>It is recommended to use `.x`/`.y`, or `.discrete_x`/`.discrete_y` as the `x`/`y` mapping.

`align_dendro()` can also split the observations into groups. 
```{r}
stack_alignv(small_mat) +                                             # <1>
    align_dendro(k = 3) +                                             # <2>
    ggalign(data = rowSums) +                                         # <3>
    geom_bar(aes(.discrete_x, value, fill = .panel), stat = "identity") +  # <4>
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2", name = "Group") +            # <5>
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text())                               # <6>
```
  1. We initialize a vertical stack.
  2. Reorder and group the observations based on hierarchical clustering, and
  add a dendrogram tree.
  3. Create a new ggplot in the layout, and use data based on the sum of the
  layout data.
  4. Add a bar layer.
  5. Set fill scale palette.
  6. Add x-axis text.

One common visualization associated with the dendrogram is the heatmap. You can
use `ggheatmap()` to initialize a heatmap layout. When grouping the observations
using `align_dendro(k = 3)`, a special column named `branch` is added, which you
can use to color the dendrogram tree.

```{r}
ggheatmap(small_mat) +                                          # <1>
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -60, hjust = 0)) + # <2>
    anno_left() +                                               # <3>
    align_dendro(aes(color = branch), k = 3) +                  # <4>
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")                        # <5>
```
  1. We initialize a heatmap layout.
  2. adjust the x-axis label theme element.
  3. we initialize an annotation in the left side of the heatmap body, and set
  it as the active context, in this way, all following addition will be directed
  to the left annotation.
  4. Reorder and group the observations based on hierarchical clustering, and
  add a dendrogram tree, coloring the tree by `branch`.
  5. Set fill scale palette.

`ggheatmap()` will automatically add axis text in the heatmap body, so you don't
need to manually adjust axis text visibility using
`theme(axis.text.x = element_text())`/`theme(axis.text.y = element_text())`.

We can also arrange the dendrogram in a circular layout to visualize
hierarchical relationships in a more compact and aesthetically pleasing way.
```{r}
circle_discrete(small_mat, radial = coord_radial(inner.radius = 0.1)) + # <1>
    ggalign() +                                                         # <2>
    geom_tile(aes(y = .column_index, fill = value)) +                   # <3>
    scale_fill_viridis_c() +                                            # <4>
    align_dendro(aes(color = branch), k = 3L) +                         # <5>
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")                               # <6>
```
  1. We initialize a circle layout and set the inner radius.
  2. Create a new ggplot in the layout, and use data the same with the layout data.
  3. Add a tile layer, the matrix input will be converted into a long formated data
  frame with column `.column_index` indicates the column index of the original matrix.
  4. Set fill scale palette.
  5. Reorder and group the observations based on hierarchical clustering, and
  add a dendrogram tree, coloring the tree by `branch`.
  6. Set color scale palette.

Having explored the core principles of `ggalign`, you should now be familiar
with its basic workflow. In the next chapter, we'll introduce the `StackLayout`,
a powerful tool for arranging multiple plots in a stacked fashion—either
horizontally or vertically—while maintaining full control over their alignment.
We'll explore how `StackLayout` and its various functions can give you even
greater flexibility in creating sophisticated layouts.
