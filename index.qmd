Welcome to [`ggalign`](https://github.com/Yunuuuu/ggalign) documents. Examples

As biomedical and multi-omics research generate increasingly complex and layered
datasets, effective data visualization becomes essential for interpretation,
communication, and discovery. Researchers often need to compare groups, track
trends across samples, or highlight structures across various biological
hierarchies — all of which demand precisely aligned plots.

However, arranging multiple plots in a consistent and interpretable layout
remains a tedious task. Existing tools offer partial solutions but often lack
the flexibility needed for nuanced biological visualizations.

`ggalign` is built to address these challenges. Based on the grammar of graphics
from `ggplot2`, it simplifies the alignment of plots across samples, features,
conditions, or clusters — helping you produce clean, publication-ready figures.

This guide introduces the key concepts and functions of `ggalign` through
practical examples. Whether you're visualizing gene expression patterns,
comparing cell clusters, or organizing panels across experiments, `ggalign`
helps you build structured and reproducible visual narratives from your data.

Thank you for choosing `ggalign`. We hope this book will inspire you to explore
the endless possibilities that come with aligned data visualization.
